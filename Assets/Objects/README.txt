Here are a few models from an old project. I hope someone can find them useful.

-They are intended to be shown mostly unlit, so the textures won't look quite right with strong lighting. 

-The texture sheets are mostly empty because I had planned on fitting a lot more stuff on them for optimization. You probably want to do something about that. Good luck!

-The scale isn't consistent across each model. 




Let me know if you use this stuff. I'd love to see what you do with them!
